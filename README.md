# SAFE Faucet app

This simple web app which gives away `ThanksCoin` alt-coins in exchange of feedback about the [SAFE Wallet](https://bochaco.github.io/) app on the SAFE Network [safe://safewallet.wow](safe://safewallet.wow). This alt-coin has no value at all, and it can only be used to experiment with its wallet within the SAFE Wallet app.

Please refer to [this post](https://safenetforum.org/t/introducing-safe-wallet-app/11764/236?u=bochaco) for details, discussions, and instructions of how to use it on the SAFE Network: [safe://safefaucet.wow](safe://safefaucet.wow).
